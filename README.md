Configuration files and other utilities I have written for convenience.

### screenshot
![screenshot showcasing swaywm configuration](./screenshot.png)

### dependencies

* main: sway, swaybg, wmenu, foot, i3blocks, fzf, brightnessctl, grim (+ slurp), fnott, libnotify-bin (notify-send)

* extra: mpv, nsxiv, lf, img2sixel, chara

### file structure

All shell scripts are stored in the `bin/` folder. Additional files (shared files, configurations) are to be stored in `etc/`.
This maps to `~/.local/bin` and `~/.local/etc` on my system.

### license
GPLv3 unless otherwise mentioned

### why sway over i3wm?

```¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯``` it just werks
