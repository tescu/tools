# tools

Scripts and other utilities I have written for convenience.
All shell scripts are stored in the `bin/' folder. Additional files (shared files, configurations) are to be stored in `share/` and `etc/`, respectively.

Scripts of note:
* `mpl` and `mplc`: Simple [mpv](https://mpv.io/)-based music player/randomizer.
