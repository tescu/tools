# dots

Configuration files and other utilities I have written for convenience.

All shell scripts are stored in the `bin/` folder. Additional files (shared files, configurations) are to be stored in `share/` and `etc/`, respectively. This maps to `~/.local/bin` and `~/.local/etc` on my system.

Scripts of note:
* `mpl` and `mplc`: Simple [mpv](https://mpv.io/)-based music player/randomizer.
